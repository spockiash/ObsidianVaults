Machine learning is field of study related to artificial intelligence, development of statistical algorithms and provides useful tools for data analysis. There are many different types of systems that employ machine learning. There are different ways to classify ML approaches.
# Training Supervision
Classification of ML systems by supervision is useful for understanding how the model works with the input training data.
## Supervised learning
The training that is fed to the algorithm includes the result trained for called **labels**. This is typical for classification and regression tasks. To train the system we feed it pairs of data and labels. The classification and regression models can be used interchangeably. 

## Unsupervised learning
The training set contains unlabeled data and the model relies only on the data to train. The usual task for this is to create clusters of data or for visualization algorithms. They are feed data and return plottable data.

They can also be used in dimensional reduction, correlating data is combined into single feature. Useful for stock indicators like `MACD` with multiple correlating components. This can also be used for feature extraction.

## Semi-supervised learning
In cases where the dataset is partially labeled this kind of learning can be useful. Some algorithms can deal with this kind of data.\

## Self-supervised learning
This kind of learning is when the algorithm is generating labeled dataset from unlabeled one.

## Reinforcement learning
The machine is considered an agent and the agent has some perception of its environment. It is learning on its own and the learning is directed by "reward" or "punishment" stimuli. This model will then learn on its own by finding optimal strategy called policy. Policy defines what agent must do during certain conditions.
