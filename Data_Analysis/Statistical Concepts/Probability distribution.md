In [probability theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_theory "Probability theory") and [statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics "Statistics"), a **probability distribution** is the mathematical [function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics) "Function (mathematics)") that gives the probabilities of occurrence of possible **outcomes** for an [experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment_(probability_theory) "Experiment (probability theory)"). It is a mathematical description of a [random](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomness "Randomness") phenomenon in terms of its [sample space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_space "Sample space") and the [probabilities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability "Probability") of [events](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_(probability_theory) "Event (probability theory)") ([subsets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subset "Subset") of the sample space).
