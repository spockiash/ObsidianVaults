Numpy is [[Python for data analysis|python]]  and stands for Numerical Python. It provides efficient ways of dealing with data and calculations. It shines in operations done on arrays. It provides mathematical functions, tools for IO and tools for linear algebra, random number generators and so on. It also provides C API to connect to libraries written in C, C++ or FORTRAN.

Numpy is designed with efficiency in mind for large data collections.
