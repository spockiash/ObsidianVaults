Numeric types are primary Python types. Most common are `int` and `float`. Integers can store arbitrary value.

Floating point numbers represent float type with double precision. They can be written scientific notation `6.17e-5`.

By default mixing integers and in division will result in converting integers to float. To get C-style casting use the floor division operator `//`.
