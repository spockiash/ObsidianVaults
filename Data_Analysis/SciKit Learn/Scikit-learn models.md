In machine learning we consider a learning problem a set of n samples of data and then predict properties of unknown data. If each sample is more then single number, it is said to have several attributes or features.

# Supervised learning models
Supervised models are ones where data comes with additional attributes that we want to predict. The models are either classifiers or regressors.
## Classification
Samples belong in two or more classes and we want to learn from already labeled data how to predict the class of unlabeled data.
## Regression
If the desired output consists of one or more continuous variables, then the task is called regression.
