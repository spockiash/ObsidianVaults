Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) is standard for describing how networks and protocols on networks are built. It contains several layers.
## Physical Layer
The physical infrastructure, cables, devices etc.. It defines hardware specifications for data transmission.
## Data Link Layer
This layer deals with physical addressing of devices (MAC address) on local networks. I basically provides structures for the interactions of the physical layer. For example ethernet. Switches for example exists on this layer. It collects data into "frames".

This layer facilitates communication between connected devices. It is allowing to pass data from one place to another.
## Network Layer
The network layer allows for packet transfer between different networks. It provides IP addressing and IP routing.
## Transport Layer
This layer provides functional and procedural means of transferring data between two destinations. TCP protocol is example of that.
## Session layer
Some protocol uses this layer but is very rare. Not that important for fundamentals right now.
## Presentation layer
Mainly historical layer, rarely used this day. For example used for transcribing between ASCII and EBCDIC (IBM coding).
## Application layer
This layer is closest to the user. HTTP protocol for example lives in this layer.
# Encapsulation
