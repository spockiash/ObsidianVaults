Social engineering is form of manipulation that uses tricks to extract confidential information from person. Usually done in a way where victim does not realize something is wrong.

## Ways of exploiting people
### Authority
* Pretend to be an authorithy
* Interact on behalf of an authority
* Exploit fear of authorithy and consequences
* To fear consequences  to the social engineer (building rapport)
### Urgency and Fear
* Authority is linked to urgency and fear
* Crating fear in the correct way can be powerful
* Threats of loosing job
### To be likable/ credible
* Generate rapport
* The goal is to be liked or loved as a target
* Flirting can be powerful as well
* Having things in common
### Reciprocity
* Quid Pro Quo
* We want to help those that help us
### Consistency
* After a commitment, people tend to force themselves to do something even if they have doubts.
* This is why we invented oaths. To school, country, religion, etc.
* If you just manage to make them say it, they will be closer to committing and doing it 
### Social adaptation
* Social adaptation can be used as weakness when exploiting target
## Steps of social engineering engagement
### OSINT and Dumpster diving
Open source intelligence is about research from publicly available sources. Dumpster diving is also useful, lot of companies throw out papers with useful information on int (logos, names, emails, phones, etc..)

Lot of information seems harmless, but it can be used for building rapport. It can be used to get names, nicknames, timelines and so on.
### Planning
- Which is going to be your ‘pretext’ for interacting?
- Which is going to be your ‘way out’ in case of discovery, police, etc?
