When the `O_CREAT` is used in access mode for the `open()` function, additional argument is needed to  define the file permission of the newly created file. This argument  uses  bit flags that can be combined together using bitwise operations. They are defined in `sys/stat.h`:
* `S_IRUSR` Give the file read permission for the user (owner)
* `S_IWUSR` Give the file write permission for the user (owner)
* `S_IXUSR` Give the file execute permission for the user (owner)
* `S_IRGRP` Give the file read permission for the group
* `S_IWGRP` Give the file write permission for the group
* `S_IXGRP` Give the file execute permission for the group
* `S_IROTH` Give the file read permission for other (anyone)
* `S_IWOTH` Give the file write permission for other (anyone)
* `S_IXOTH` Give the file execute permission for other (anyone)
# Unix file permissions
Every file has its permissions. These can be displayed with `ls -l` command:
```sh
bobo@bobo-ws ➜ ls -l /etc/passwd /tmp/notes ~/Desktop/Samples/Sample.txt    
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 1911 19. čen 14.57 /etc/passwd  
-rw-r--r-- 1 bobo bobo   94 16. zář 00.37 /home/bobo/Desktop/Samples/Sample.txt  
-rw------- 1 bobo bobo   29 24. zář 13.04 /tmp/notes
```
Every file has owner and a group. For the `passwd` file the owner is a root and group also as root. The read, write and execute can be turned on and off for these different fields: user, group and other. In the `ls -l` command first 3 flags are for user, next 3 are group and last 3 are other. Each permission is bit flag, read is 4(100 in binary), write is 2 (010 in binary) and execute is 1 (001 in binary). Since each value contains unique bits, bitwise operations provide same result as adding them together. Example here: [[File Access#Flags demo]].
These values can be added together to define permissions for user, group and the other using `chmod` command.
## Using `chmod`
```sh
bobo@bobo-ws ➜ chmod 731 Sample.txt    
bobo@bobo-ws ➜ ls -l Sample.txt    
-rwx-wx--x 1 bobo bobo 94 16. zář 00.37 Sample.txt
```
This command gives read, write and execute rights to user, since 7 = 4+2+1.  Write and execute permissions to the group (3=2+1) and only execute permission to the other.
```sh
bobo@bobo-ws ➜ chmod ugo-wx Sample.txt  
bobo@bobo-ws ➜ ls -l Sample.txt          
-r-------- 1 bobo bobo 94 16. zář 00.37 Sample.txt
```
Permission can be also added or subtracted, this shows that we can remove read and execute for user, group and other.
```sh
bobo@bobo-ws ➜ ls -l Sample.txt       
-rw------- 1 bobo bobo 94 16. zář 00.37 Sample.txt
```
