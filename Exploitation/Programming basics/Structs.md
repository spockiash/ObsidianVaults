Structs allow for grouping of variables and are commonly used in libraries and functions.
```c
struct tm {
	int    tm_sec   seconds [0,61]
	int    tm_min   minutes [0,59]
	int    tm_hour  hour [0,23]
	int    tm_mday  day of month [1,31]
	int    tm_mon   month of year [0,11]
	int    tm_year  years since 1900
	int    tm_wday  day of week [0,6] (Sunday = 0)
	int    tm_yday  day of year [0,365]
	int    tm_isdst daylight savings flag
}
```
This is example of a struct that represents time in `time.h`. Struct provides a way to define custom type in c made from the grouped variables. When struct is defined, we can use that struct to declare variables and pointers.
# Time example 1
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <time.h>

int main() {
    long int seconds_since_epoch;
    struct tm current_time, *time_ptr;
    int hour, minute, second, day, month, year;

    seconds_since_epoch = time(0); //Pass time a null pointer as argument
    printf("time() --> seconds since epoch %ld\n", seconds_since_epoch);

    time_ptr = &current_time; //set time_ptr pointer to current time
    localtime_r(&seconds_since_epoch, time_ptr);

    //3 different ways of accessing struct elements
    hour = current_time.tm_hour; //Direct access
    minute = time_ptr->tm_min; //pointer access
    second = *((int*) time_ptr); //Hacky pointer access

    printf("Current time is: %02d:%02d:%02d\n", hour, minute, second);
}
```
The `time()` will return seconds since January 1st, 1970. This arbitrary period is called epoch. The `localtime_r` expects two arguments, one is number of seconds since epoch and the other is `tm` struct.

The pointer `time_ptr` has already been set to address of `current_time` empty `tm` struct. The address-of operator `&` is used with the `seconds_since_epoch` for the argument of `localtime_r` function, which fills the elements of the provided `tm` struct.

The struct can be accessed simply by using the name of the struct element after period:
```c
int hour = current_time.tm_hour;
```
Pointer access is more widely used, because it is more efficient. It allows for passing only the referenced element and not the entire data structure. C has built-in method for accessing struct elements from struct pointer without needing to dereference the pointer. To do that C uses this character symbol set `->` to access struct elements via the pointer:
```c
int minute = time_ptr->tm_min;
```
The third option uses fact that seconds are stored at the beginning of the memory within the struct. Therefore when we use typecasting on the pointer, we can extract the first bits that correspond to our type:
```c
int second =*((int *) time_ptr)
```
The variable is typecasted into integer, then the value is dereferenced from the pointer. Since the address of `time_ptr` also points to the address of first element of this struct, this will retrieve the integer value of seconds.
