A [[Basics of C#Pointers|pointer]] is simply contains a memory address and is given a data type that describes what it is pointing to. Pointers can be made to point to functions. They can be used like this:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int func_one()
{
    printf("this is function one\n");
    return 1;
}

int func_two()
{
    printf("this is function two\n");
    return 1;
}
int main() {
    int value;
    int (*function_pointer) ();

    function_pointer = func_one;
    printf("function_pointer is %p\n", function_pointer);
    value = function_pointer();
    printf("value returned was %d\n", value);

    function_pointer = func_two;
    printf("function_pointer is %p\n", function_pointer);
    value = function_pointer();
    printf("value returned was %d\n", value);
}
```
The output of this program will be:
```sh
bobo@bobo-ws âžœ ./func_pointer                    
function_pointer is 0x5c86fd06d149
this is function one
value returned was 1
function_pointer is 0x5c86fd06d163
this is function two
value returned was 1
```
