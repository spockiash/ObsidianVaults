# TCP/IP
The data flows from layer to layer
## Data Link
This layer has responsibility to communicate with mediums. This is the actual physical infrastructure like copper, optical, sound and wireless infrastructure.
## Internet Layer
The key responsibility of Internet Layer is routing. This layer contains many protocols such as IP, ICMP protocol and others.
## Transport Layer
This layer is responsible for transporting data between sender and receiver. This layer contains many protocols such as TCP and UDP and even SCPT.
## Application Layer
Protocols in this layer are more high level like HTTP, SSH, TELNET, FTP and SMTP.
# Basic Network Protocols
## ARP
* Address resolution protocol
* Makes resolution between an IPv4 and an ethernet MAC address
### ARP Announcement Packet
* Announce which MAC address is yours
* In the ethernet header, it uses the broadcast destination
* In ARP header the sender
The ARP header
## ICMP
Internet control message protocol. In its headert, it has type filed(255 options) and code field that defines functionality:
* Type 0, code 0: Echo reply
* Type 8, code 0: Echo request
## TCP
Three-way handshake is used in TCP.
## UDP
UDP is not connection-oriented.
## SCTP
New kind of protocol, Stream Control Transmission Protocol, that combines the properties of TCP and UDP. It is message oriented, but combines it with TCP.
## HTTP
It is hypertext transfer protocol. This is the "web" protocol. It is the most complex and extended protocol so far. It is very widely used.
### HTTP/1.0 and 1.1
It is text based
```sh
oot@hackerlab:~# ncat 1.1.1.1 80  
GET / HTTP/1.1  
Host: 1.1.1.1  
  
HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently  
Server: cloudflare

Content-Type: text/html  
Content-Length: 167  
Connection: keep-alive

CF-RAY: 8c9422820a876e99-PRG

<body>  
<center><h1>301 Moved Permanently</h1></center>

</html>
```
### HTTP/2
THis protocol uses binary for communication. It is more efficient, because of header compression. With this protocol we can now do data without requests. The server can push data to you. It has option for several resources per connection.

### HTTP/3
Improved over previous version. No more TCP, it is UDP + QUICK.
## TLS
Transport layer security protocol, it encrypts connections between client and server, ensuring confidentiality, integrity and authentication.

## DNS
Domain Name System, it is distributed hierarchical protocol.  It allows for DNS tunneling. DNS is also complex protocol like HTTP.

## IPv6
It is 128-bit address.
