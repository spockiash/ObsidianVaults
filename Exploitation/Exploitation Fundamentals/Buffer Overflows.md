Buffer overflows are very old and still exists to this day. It is one of the most common exploit techniques. C as high level language assumes the programmer has full control of data integrity. If this responsibility would be moved to the compiler, the resulted binaries would be much slower.

When we define type of certain size, the language does not offer any safeguards and such operation is allowed. Therefore we can put  bytes of data into buffer with size of 8. This will most likely cause the program to crash. This is known as buffer overrun of buffer overflow. This will cause spilling of the  data outside of the defined memory, overwriting whatever data is located next to the buffer. If critical piece of data is overwritten, it will cause a crash.
