Erlang was developed by Ericsson in the 1980's for communications purposes. It was designed so it would be:
* Fault tolerant - errors are localized and does not cause system wide outage
* Scalability - the system can be expanded without outages
* Distribution - the system is distributed across multiple machines
* Responsiveness - the system is always online
* Live update - In some cases we need to push update without disrupting availability
