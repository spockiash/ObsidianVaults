This vault contains notes on game concept and development.
# Overview
The game is first person shooter inspired by Lethal Company. As opposed to LC this game will not feature multiplayer until much later. This is GDD for proof of concept before multiplayer version is considered.

Main themes are dungeon crawling, horror, DnD/biblical like monsters and hell. It will feature dark magic and Satanism themes. It could be categorized as monster hunting game, because player will try to map out stuff.

## The gameplay loop
Player will assume role of a character. Player will have home base level, where there is low threat level. The home base level will act as staging area for player with basic research and upgrade crafting.
Player will be entering hand crafted dungeon (abandoned underground catacombs). Player will be exploring the dungeon and collecting loot, discovering secrets and encountering monsters. Player will be killing the monsters, collecting samples for research.
The more research and exploration the player does, more of the dungeon opens. The goal is to get rid of all the monsters inside the dungeon. 

## Story
Player assumes role of an agent of mysterious organization. The game area is an abandoned church where occult experiments were done. These experiments went horribly wrong but the experimenters managed to contain the monster invasion inside the catacombs.
The role of a player is to discover what went wrong, finish the research and get rid of the problem at hand.

## The World
The mysterious organization (The Org from now) is doing weird occult experiments. It is using ritualistic magic and studies it using modern scientific methods (game is set in 1970s).

Magic works using rituals, humans do not have the ability to use magic by themselves. They can however use rituals to grant themselves powers. To perform such rituals is daunting task and only very few people can manage to do those.

The rituals are based on demonology studies and the performer in the ritual must bend literal demons and force them to grant powers to them. If this fails, the consequences are dire for the performer. Usually comes at cost of possession. Sometimes at cost of the persons soul.

The performers can use the protection of divine powers, when facing demons divine protection is required. Any kind of divinity is acceptable depending on what believe system the person knows. Divine protection is universal for most human religions.

## The Monsters
The monsters have physical bodies. They have biology of terrestrial animals but somehow altered beyond recognition. The monsters origin is unknown.
